# Day 0 - The Back Story


Starting (more on this later) my journey to **Software Developer** using the [Dockyard Academy Curriculm](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum) which is produced by Brooklin Myers and is the instructor for DockYard Academy and the content creator for those participating in the full-time bootcamp.

I originally became aware of Brooklyn from his podcast, [Elixer Newbie](https://www.elixirnewbie.com/), before he started working with [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/) as an instructor and began making this course.

As a technologist, I have also been keen to figure out hope different things work. Often that person who everyone goes to for help fixing anything.

I have been a Public Safety Telecommunicator (PST), aka 911 Operator, Police dispatcher, or one of the other numerous ways my job has been described, for over a decade and a half. Raising through the ranks to a Supervisor at a *"small"* regional emergency communications center, I have come to a point where this job isn't enough for me. A realization that was a faint realization soon after the birth of my second child. A time I used to look into and research gaining knowledge into networking. Going down the rabbit hole of Youtube videos, namely those by [Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0AN7BWHpCDHSm9NiJFJQ), a seriously good source for information. Unfortunately, there was no calling to *want* to learn more and pursue this line of work.

COVID happened, and shockingly this only made me want to career change a little more. The biggest push came from *home-life*, having three kids and being mandated to go to work while my amazing wife did her job remotely and handled the kids. Work-wise, the lack of staffing that started at the end of the previous year fueled my urning to leave but was mild at best.


## I had started and failed to complete the following before starting this.

**The Udemy Collector:**
- Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp & The Advanced Web Developer
- Andrei Neagoie (from Zero to Mastery) The Complete Web Developer

**Other Bootcamps:**
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [App Academy Open](https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open?)
- [FlatIron](https://flatironschool.com/)
- [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)

**Earlier this Year:**

- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)
- [Django for Everybody](https://www.dj4e.com/)


I definitely have started, stopped, started again, and stopped again, and so on and so on! Some (*including myself*) that I have a history of failing and that maybe this was not for me.

But I would counter that notion with I want this and I will find a way to get there. Those experiences have led me to where I am currently. Something that I can attest to, during the portion of Professor Charles Severance's two courses, PY4E and DJ4E, I found myself thinking more and more about Elixir and the Phoneix framework. Something inside of me was saying that Elixir is what I want and that was *"wasting"* my time learning something that would not fit what I wanted to do. These resources were great (albeit that I did not use them completely), they just did not speak to me. For some strange reason Elixir does..


## Expectations

I will be learning this course in public, something that [Shawn (@swyx) Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) talks about. It is something I haven't let myself go and do previously. As I go through this course I plan to track my progress each *"day"* with blog notes to document my stumbling blocks and wins and ultimately try to pay it forward. This will eventually become part of a website, as time permits but till then it will be housed on GitHub. If you are reading this then you are ahead of me and everyone else, welcome and enjoy!

More to come.
