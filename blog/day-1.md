# Day 1 - The fight with Github

## The Start - The easy part

Made a GitHub login and a repo for tracking solutions for this course.

**The Rabbit-Hole Begins**

This feels like a "time-suck" but I also understand this is something I'm going to have to master as it's "table stakes" for being a software engineer. Keep telling myself that this is like any computer game mostly a console game (**pun intended**), where it's just beating levels till the end and enjoying the progress.

  - Figuring out the *"Main"* versus *"Solutions"* for local devolping on my computer to track progress.
  - Command for resetting your *Origin* so you can properly pull updates from the correct Git Repo and not your Soltuion's Repo
    - `` git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum.git ``
  - Set my repo for Solutions branch
   - ``git remote add upstream  https://github.com/TheGriffinCircus/dockyard-academy-solutions.git``
  - Sitting here, banging my head on the table. Hoping for *"AH-HA Moment"* and it's not coming, this needs to be simpler for self-led.
    - Choosing to skip for now and revisit.
    - IS this the solution??? - ``git push upstream command-line-reading`` Will have to revisit, this?
    - Setup SSH or personal token for access.[Further reading and reference from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls)



## Bonus: Day 1.5 - Github Continued

So.... went from banging my head on the desk to shaking it in disbelief. As the next reading was Git, are you thinking what I was? Why did you not look at the chapters to come, especially since it was right under the Reading I clicked on, Command Line.

My anger towards Git would not allow me to do anything more than skim the chapter to see what it said and realize I should have moved on sooner. I will revisit this with a calmer head.

After crawling over all that broken glass, I started to read the Livebook chapter. Realized that there was a change to Livebook's keyboard shortcut to evaluate the Elixir cells the course stated it should be ``ea``, researching the [LiveBook documentation](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) I found it should be ``ee`` and submitted an issue. You can see it here, [Livebook Shortcut Change #811](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum/issues/811), something that I had never done. I was always afraid to submit changes or issues because as you can tell from above Github and I haven't gotten along. Something that I will work on going forward
