# Day 2 - Reading Continued, GitHub revisited

## Before the Course

I'm not big for social media, those who I work with would call me a "boomer" as I only have a Facebook account and barely post or check it. But learning in public means.... say it with me... learning in public **and** making it public. So I did the unthinkable, made a Twitter account [@thgriffincircus](https://twitter.com/thgriffincircus), and posted my first tweet documenting my progress.

Something that I learned from [Danny Thompson](https://limey.io/dthompsondev) is that you need to be networking. Knowing how to code is not enough, you need to know people. I would also recommend his [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54X5yR8qizsMpvTCqUIEFMeEp-chvcxk) on using LinkedIn for getting a job.


## Visual Studio Code Editor

Because I'm still feeling upset with GitHub, I moved forward before with VS Code before going back to GitHub. Did anyone else see that coming?

With my previous foray into learning software engineering, I had already installed VS Code. Ironically I'm currently using it to write this article.

The commands section was very helpful, and actually gave me the confidence to possibly ask if I can fix the previous Issue that was submitted by using the **search-and-replace** process along with the Source Control tab within VS Code. Seems straightforward to make the submission, along with the learning benefit of doing so.

Update to follow...

Also...
- [] TODO: Revisit IDE Keyboard Shortcuts. Something I need more time using but probably need to change some.

## GitHub now? Nope onto IEx

Using Help(h), the example is on ``Enum`` used ``h Enum``, and when you use the Information (I) helper ``i Enum`` you find out that you could also do the same help function as ``h(Enum)``. Found that interesting.

By the end of this chapter, I felt a little drained. Realized I had not taken a break from reading and typing this blog entry for a few hours. A far better *Rabbit hole* than yesterday!

The chapter had several terms with follow-up reading on the [Hex Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.Helpers.html#functions) and [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/iex_helpers).


## Github... Still pushing it off moving on to the  Exercises

- Command Line Family Tree - Quick exercise, nothing of real note
- GitHub Engineering Journal - Ironically this was the start of a *"public"* journal so to say. But decided to make a separate journal as suggested to practice my GitHub use. What would you know slammed back into reality with an issue of pulling a private repo. GitHub is my Chimera and it's going to be slayed.... at some point.


## VS Code for the double win

I haven't given up, just pivoting. My wife loves Friends, in one episode Ross is moving a couch and keeps loudly saying "Pivot"..."Pivot" and that is what I hear in my head right now. I haven't solved the command line issue that I'm having. But during the VS Code exploration, I got GitHub to connect and I'm committing that way.

Able to `push` to GitHub several updates to the Journal will have to circle around to adding Foam.

- [] TODO: Add Foam, [Foam Docs](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), at a later time.

## Github Collab: Bummer for Self-Led!

Don't have a partner(s) for this part. Might be added to the **TODO** list, but more likely I will try to explore the open-source portion.

Watch out Brooklin, cause I'm thinking the best way it by helping you as I go through the  [Dockyard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum) by submitting fixes.
